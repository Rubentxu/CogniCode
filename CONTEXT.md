# Context — CogniCode

## Project Mission
CogniCode is a code intelligence platform that provides graph-based exploration, vertical slice tracing, and AI-augmented analysis of software systems.

## Core Concepts

### Graph Model
- **GraphNode**: Any code entity (symbol, file, module, decision, doc, issue, evidence, component, container, system)
- **GraphEdge**: Relationships between nodes (dependency, calls, cites, resolves, etc.)
- **NodeKind**: Taxonomy of node types — Symbol (22 kinds), Decision, Doc, Issue, Evidence, Component, Container, System
- **EdgeKind**: Taxonomy of relationships — Dependency (8 kinds), Cites, Justifies, Resolves, CorroboratedBy, PartOf, DeployedAs, InSystem
- **SymbolRepository**: Read-only port for symbol identity resolution — `resolve`, `find_symbols_by_name`, `find_symbols_by_file`, `all_symbols`, `graph_stats`, `module_list`. Does NOT navigate the call graph.
- **GraphQueryPort**: Read-only port for structural graph navigation — neighbors with metadata (`provenance`, `confidence`), multi-hop traversals (`traverse`, `subgraph`). MoldQL compiles its queries to operations of this port. Replaces the deprecated `MetadataAwareRepository` + `as_metadata_aware()` escape hatch.
- **ToolHandler**: ISP-segregated trait for MCP tool dispatch. Each tool family (graph, views, search, sessions) registers its handlers via registry. The MCP handler dispatches by tool name — no central match arms. Same pattern as `ViewExecutor`.

### Visualization
- **ContextualView**: A graph view with focus node + surrounding context (parent/children/same_level)
- **Vertical Slice**: Trace from ANY entry point through entire call graph + data flow — the core pain point this project solves
- **Entry Point**: Any valid starting point — HTTP route, CLI command, event handler, use case name, or any symbol
- **Moldable View Runtime**: Hybrid backend/frontend system for discovering, defining, rendering, and persisting custom views
- **ViewSpec**: Declarative runtime view definition stored as data — `{ id, title, applies_to, view_kind, data_source, transform, renderer_kind, props }`
- **ViewKind**: Semantic view intent — what the user wants to understand, such as vertical slice, call graph, seam map, C4 view, impact radius, or source view.
- **RendererKind**: Visual rendering strategy — how a ViewSpec is displayed, such as graph, table, tree, code, markdown, Vega-Lite, JSON, or composite.
- **HierarchyKind**: Navigable structural projection used by views and data sources, such as file tree, module tree, type hierarchy, call hierarchy, package graph, or C4 hierarchy.
- **RendererRegistry**: Frontend registry that maps renderer ids (`graph`, `table`, `tree`, `code`, `vega-lite`) to React components
- **MoldQL**: Query language for selecting code objects, graph relations, docs, evidence, and architecture artifacts. MoldQL is a data-source/query language, not a visual layout DSL.

### Entry Points
All of the following are valid starting points for exploration:
- HTTP route path (e.g., `POST /api/users`)
- CLI command name (e.g., `cognicode analyze`)
- Event name (e.g., `UserCreated`)
- Use case name (e.g., `CreateUser`)
- Any symbol (function, type, variable)
- Search result from Spotter/Search
- Saved exploration
- ViewSpec
- ADR, decision, doc, issue, or evidence object

Entry points resolve through a common pipeline:

```text
User input
  ↓
EntryPointResolver
  ↓
ResolvedEntryPoint
  ↓
Default ViewKind selection
  ↓
ViewSpec or built-in view
  ↓
RendererRegistry
```

Each entry point type has a default `ViewKind`, but the user can switch views
from the Explorer after resolution. Examples:

- `POST /api/users` → `ResolvedEntryPoint::HttpRoute` → `vertical_slice`
- `cognicode analyze` → `ResolvedEntryPoint::CliCommand` → `vertical_slice`
- `UserCreated` → `ResolvedEntryPoint::Event` → `data_flow`
- `CreateUser` → `ResolvedEntryPoint::UseCase` → `vertical_slice`
- `UserRepository::save` → `ResolvedEntryPoint::Symbol` → `call_graph`

Search/Spotter is a universal entry point. It searches symbols, files, modules,
entry points, ViewSpecs, ADRs, decisions, docs, issues, evidence, and saved
explorations. Search results are not a flat list; they are represented as the
`semantic_search_results` ViewKind so the result set can be filtered, grouped,
rendered differently, saved as a ViewSpec, or opened as inspector panes.

### Architecture Principles
- **Clean/Hexagonal Architecture**: Vertical slices cross layers (HTTP → UseCase → Domain → Repository → DB)
- **No WASM in browser**: Never duplicate backend logic in the frontend
- **Layout split**:
  - Backend produces deterministic tree layout (useful for API/MCP consumers)
  - Frontend applies force-directed / interactive layouts
- **Two intelligence sources**: MCP tools (structured) + LLM (unstructured reasoning)
- **Explorer-first moldability**: The Explorer UI is the primary consumer of custom runtime views; MCP may expose degraded non-visual access to ViewSpecs
- **Hybrid navigation**: Frontend owns rich visual navigation state; backend persists semantic exploration state for restore, sharing, and MCP
- **Composition root**: `cognicode-runtime` crate is the single place where concrete implementations are selected and dependencies assembled. Binaries are thin: parse args → bootstrap → serve. PostgreSQL is the only persistence backend.

### LLM Integration (gt4llm patterns)
- **Chat Registry**: Named chat sessions with world-view scope
- **Playground**: Scratchpad for exploratory chat
- **Assistant vs Direct**: Two chat models — Assistant (structured JSON schema) vs Direct (unstructured)
- **Lepiter**: Pages with evaluable snippets, linkable to code objects
- **RAG**: Vector DB + chunking strategy for code-aware retrieval

### View Discovery
- **ViewRegistry**: Compile-time registry for built-in views, preferably linkme/distributed-slice or the existing LensRegistry-style trait-object pattern
- **InspectableObjectType**: Enum of object types that can have views (Symbol, File, Scope, Issue, Rule, Component, Container, System, Decision, Doc, Evidence)
- **ViewDescriptor**: ISP-segregated trait providing metadata-only access to a view's identity (`id`, `title`, `applies_to`, `view_kind`, `renderer_kind`). Consumers that only list views depend on this trait and know nothing about `build()`.
- **ViewExecutor**: Trait extending `ViewDescriptor` with `async build(ctx: &ViewContext) -> ContextualView`. The capability that constructs a view from a pre-resolved target. Registry stores `dyn ViewExecutor` — no downcast needed.
- **InspectionTarget**: Enum carrying pre-resolved object data (`Symbol(ResolvedSymbol)`, `File { path, symbols }`, `Scope { path, files, symbols }`, `Issue(QualityIssue)`, `Rule { rule_id }`) passed to view capabilities.
- **ViewContext**: Struct carrying `&InspectionTarget` + ports (`&dyn SymbolRepository`, `&dyn SourceReader`, `Option<&dyn QualityRepository>`) passed to `ViewExecutor::build()`. The service resolves identity and prepares this context; capabilities only build.
- **ContextualView**: The rendered view — `{ object_id, view_id, blocks: Vec<ViewBlock>, relations, evidence, findings }`
- **ViewBlock**: Generic JSON block `{ id, title, body: serde_json::Value }` — render-type agnostic
- **2-phase construction**: View descriptor listing → view instantiation with target (matches gtoolkit pattern)
- **GtPager**: Tab-based inspector with paging

### Moldable View Runtime
CogniCode view discovery has four layers:

1. **Built-in views** — Rust-defined views discovered by ViewRegistry; type-safe, compiled, used for core views such as overview, call graph, source, quality.
2. **Runtime ViewSpecs** — user-defined declarative views persisted as data; appear immediately in the Explorer without recompiling.
3. **Frontend RendererRegistry** — React-side renderer catalog; maps declarative renderer ids to concrete components such as Cytoscape, table, tree, code, Vega-Lite, and raw JSON.
4. **Advanced extension host** — future/pro tier for remote renderers or plugin-based custom components; explicitly out of scope for v1.

v1 supports only built-in renderers plus declarative ViewSpecs. External
plugins, remote React renderers, Module Federation runtime remotes, WASM view
plugins, and embedded scripting runtimes are not part of v1.

ViewSpecs separate semantic intent from visual representation:

- **ViewKind** answers: "what system concept is this view explaining?"
- **RendererKind** answers: "which visual component renders it?"

Examples:

| ViewKind | Typical RendererKind |
|----------|----------------------|
| `vertical_slice` | `composite` (`graph` + `tree` + `code` + `table`) |
| `call_graph` | `graph` |
| `seam_map` | `graph` + `table` |
| `c4_context` | `graph` or `tree` |
| `c4_container` | `graph` or `tree` |
| `c4_component` | `graph` or `tree` |
| `c4_code` | `tree` + `code` |
| `dependency_graph` | `graph` |
| `source_view` | `code` |
| `quality_hotspots` | `table` + `vega-lite` |
| `evidence_view` | `markdown` + `table` |
| `decision_graph` | `graph` + `markdown` |
| `diff_view` | `code` |
| `data_flow` | `graph` |
| `impact_radius` | `graph` + `table` |

First-class ViewKind catalog:

**Architecture views**
- `architecture_rationale` — explains why a structure exists using ADRs, decisions, evidence, and related code.
- `architecture_drift` — shows where code diverges from ADRs, expected C4 structure, or documented boundaries.
- `boundary_map` — shows boundaries between modules, crates, layers, bounded contexts, or components.
- `dependency_pressure` — highlights modules with excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies.
- `change_impact_story` — explains what a change affects, who depends on it, and which tests/docs should move with it.
- `ownership_map` — shows ownership of crates, modules, ADRs, issues, components, or slices.
- `risk_map` — combines hotspots, churn, complexity, debt, and criticality.
- `decision_trace` — connects ADRs → code → tests → docs → issues.

**Development views**
- `test_slice` — connects an entry point to the tests that cover that flow.
- `debug_slice` — connects an error, crash, or log to probable execution paths and relevant symbols.
- `refactor_plan` — shows what to move or change, affected dependencies, and a safe order of operations.
- `callers_and_implementors` — shows callers, callees, trait implementors, and related usage.
- `usage_examples` — shows real usages of a function, type, module, API, or ViewSpec.
- `api_surface` — shows public API of a crate/module plus stability and consumers.
- `dead_code_candidates` — shows symbols with no callers or no observable use.
- `semantic_search_results` — treats search results as a moldable collection rather than a flat list.

**Living documentation views**
- `doc_code_alignment` — compares docs/ADRs/concepts with the code that implements them.
- `example_object` — executable or reproducible example that materializes a concept.
- `composed_narrative` — navigable story made of objects, views, evidence, and explanations.
- `project_diary` — technical diary for decisions, experiments, snippets, and linked artifacts.
- `concept_map` — map of domain terms and their relationships to code, ADRs, issues, and evidence.
- `evidence_pack` — bundle of evidence used to justify a decision, change, or review outcome.

`project_diary` and `composed_narrative` are the v1 living-documentation
equivalent of Lepiter. They are based on markdown narrative plus embedded
ViewSpecs, linked objects, evidence packs, and decision traces. Executable
snippets are a future capability, not required for v1.

All catalogued ViewKinds are first-class domain vocabulary. Implementation can
be phased, but the names are reserved so future work does not lose the intended
capabilities.

First-class hierarchy kinds for v1:

- `file_tree` — workspace → directories → files
- `module_tree` — crate → module → items
- `type_hierarchy` — traits, impls, inheritance-like relations, and implementors
- `call_hierarchy` — callers and callees
- `package_graph` — crates, packages, and dependency relationships
- `c4_hierarchy` — system → container → component → code

Backend responsibilities:
- Resolve objects and entry points
- Provide graph/code/data sources
- Execute MoldQL queries as ViewSpec data sources
- Persist and validate ViewSpecs
- List applicable built-in and custom views

Frontend responsibilities:
- Render ViewSpecs through RendererRegistry
- Provide Explorer-first authoring UX for custom views
- Provide live preview while users create or edit ViewSpecs
- Run safe client-side transforms for visual exploration, with JSONata preferred for JSON reshaping and aggregation

MCP responsibilities:
- List, read, and execute ViewSpecs when possible
- Degrade gracefully for views that require browser-only renderers

Custom ViewSpec authoring is Explorer-first:

1. User inspects an object.
2. User selects **Create custom view**.
3. User chooses a `ViewKind`.
4. User chooses a `RendererKind`.
5. User selects a data source.
6. User adjusts a JSONata transform.
7. Explorer shows live preview.
8. User saves the result as a persisted `ViewSpec`.

Editing raw JSON is supported as an advanced/debug path, but it is not the
primary authoring workflow.

MoldQL is used inside ViewSpecs to select data, not to describe layout. Visual
layout remains the responsibility of `RendererKind`, renderer props, and the
frontend `RendererRegistry`.

Examples:

```text
symbols where kind = "function" and fan_out > 5
calls from "UserService::create_user" depth 3
docs citing adr "ADR-008"
```

### Navigation
- **Explorer Navigation State**: Frontend-owned visual state — open panes, active tabs, selected nodes, scroll, split layout, and visual breadcrumbs.
- **ExplorationSession**: Backend-owned semantic state — ordered navigation events `{ object_id, view_id, query, timestamp }` for restore, sharing, and MCP.
- **Navigation Stack**: User-facing drill-down history derived from Explorer state and periodically synchronized to the backend.
- **Inspector Pane Stack**: GtPager-like lateral stack of object inspections. Each pane owns `{ object_id, active_view_id, available_views, local_state, outgoing_links }`.
- **Shareable Exploration**: A persisted semantic exploration path that can be restored in the Explorer or inspected by MCP with degraded non-visual fidelity.

Explorer inspection is pane-based, not replacement-based. Clicking a related
object opens a new pane to the right instead of replacing the current object.
This preserves the exploration narrative:

```text
[Entry Point] → [Symbol] → [Repository] → [Decision] → [Test]
```
