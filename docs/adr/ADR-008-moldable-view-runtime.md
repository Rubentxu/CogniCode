## Context

CogniCode wants to recreate the useful parts of Glamorous Toolkit's moldable UI: navigability, auto-discovery, many views per object, custom views, hierarchy exploration, entry points, and extensibility.

In Glamorous Toolkit, a contextual view is defined as a method annotated with `<gtView>`. The inspector discovers these methods dynamically through the Smalltalk runtime. This makes views cheap to create and immediately visible while exploring a domain.

Rust does not provide equivalent runtime reflection. A pure Rust trait-based registry gives compile-time safety, but it does not support instant user-defined views without recompilation. The Explorer UI is the primary consumer of these custom views; MCP consumers can receive degraded non-visual access.

## Decision

Adopt a **Moldable View Runtime** composed of four layers:

1. **Built-in ViewRegistry**
   - Rust-defined core views.
   - Discovered through `linkme`/distributed slices or a LensRegistry-style trait-object registry.
   - Used for stable views such as overview, call graph, source, evidence, quality, dependencies, and hotspots.

2. **Runtime ViewSpec Store**
   - User-created views are stored as declarative JSON data, not Rust code.
   - A ViewSpec separates semantic intent (`ViewKind`) from visual rendering (`RendererKind`).
   - A ViewSpec describes what concept the user is exploring, what data to fetch, how to transform it, and which renderer should display it.
   - Runtime ViewSpecs appear in the Explorer immediately without recompiling the backend.

3. **Frontend RendererRegistry**
   - The Explorer owns visual rendering.
   - Renderer ids such as `graph`, `table`, `tree`, `code`, `vega-lite`, and `raw-json` map to React components.
   - Backend sends ViewSpecs and data; frontend chooses the concrete renderer.
   - The Explorer provides the primary authoring workflow for runtime ViewSpecs.

4. **Advanced Extension Host**
   - Future/pro tier for remote renderer components or plugin-based custom visualizations.
   - Inspired by VS Code contribution points, custom editors, and webviews.
   - Explicitly out of scope for v1.

v1 supports only built-in renderers plus declarative ViewSpecs. External
plugins, remote React renderers, Module Federation runtime remotes, WASM view
plugins, and embedded scripting runtimes are not part of v1.

The minimal ViewSpec shape is:

```json
{
  "id": "hot-symbols",
  "title": "Hot Symbols",
  "applies_to": "Scope",
  "view_kind": "quality_hotspots",
  "data_source": {
    "kind": "moldql",
    "query": "symbols where fan_out > 5"
  },
  "transform": {
    "language": "jsonata",
    "expression": "nodes[fan_out > 5]"
  },
  "renderer_kind": "table",
  "props": {
    "columns": ["label", "kind", "fan_out"]
  }
}
```

The first-class `ViewKind` values include, at minimum:

- `vertical_slice`
- `call_graph`
- `seam_map`
- `c4_context`
- `c4_container`
- `c4_component`
- `c4_code`
- `dependency_graph`
- `source_view`
- `quality_hotspots`
- `evidence_view`
- `decision_graph`
- `diff_view`
- `data_flow`
- `impact_radius`

The full first-class catalog also reserves architecture, development, and
living-documentation views. These names are part of the domain vocabulary even
when implementation is phased:

**Architecture views**

- `architecture_rationale` — explains why a structure exists using ADRs, decisions, evidence, and related code.
- `architecture_drift` — shows where code diverges from ADRs, expected C4 structure, or documented boundaries.
- `boundary_map` — shows boundaries between modules, crates, layers, bounded contexts, or components.
- `dependency_pressure` — highlights modules with excessive incoming or outgoing dependencies.
- `change_impact_story` — explains what a change affects, who depends on it, and which tests/docs should move with it.
- `ownership_map` — shows ownership of crates, modules, ADRs, issues, components, or slices.
- `risk_map` — combines hotspots, churn, complexity, debt, and criticality.
- `decision_trace` — connects ADRs → code → tests → docs → issues.

**Development views**

- `test_slice` — connects an entry point to the tests that cover that flow.
- `debug_slice` — connects an error, crash, or log to probable execution paths and relevant symbols.
- `refactor_plan` — shows what to move or change, affected dependencies, and a safe order of operations.
- `callers_and_implementors` — shows callers, callees, trait implementors, and related usage.
- `usage_examples` — shows real usages of a function, type, module, API, or ViewSpec.
- `api_surface` — shows public API of a crate/module plus stability and consumers.
- `dead_code_candidates` — shows symbols with no callers or no observable use.
- `semantic_search_results` — treats search results as a moldable collection rather than a flat list.

**Living documentation views**

- `doc_code_alignment` — compares docs/ADRs/concepts with the code that implements them.
- `example_object` — executable or reproducible example that materializes a concept.
- `composed_narrative` — navigable story made of objects, views, evidence, and explanations.
- `project_diary` — technical diary for decisions, experiments, snippets, and linked artifacts.
- `concept_map` — map of domain terms and their relationships to code, ADRs, issues, and evidence.
- `evidence_pack` — bundle of evidence used to justify a decision, change, or review outcome.

`project_diary` and `composed_narrative` are the v1 living-documentation
equivalent of Lepiter. They use markdown narrative plus embedded ViewSpecs,
linked objects, evidence packs, and decision traces. Executable snippets are a
future capability and are not required for v1.

The first-class `RendererKind` values include, at minimum:

- `graph`
- `table`
- `tree`
- `code`
- `markdown`
- `vega-lite`
- `json`
- `composite`

The first-class `HierarchyKind` values for v1 include:

- `file_tree` — workspace → directories → files
- `module_tree` — crate → module → items
- `type_hierarchy` — traits, impls, inheritance-like relations, and implementors
- `call_hierarchy` — callers and callees
- `package_graph` — crates, packages, and dependency relationships
- `c4_hierarchy` — system → container → component → code

Hierarchy kinds are not renderers. They are structural data projections used by
ViewSpecs and normally rendered with `tree`, `graph`, or `composite` renderers.

Runtime ViewSpecs are authored primarily through the Explorer:

1. Inspect an object.
2. Select **Create custom view**.
3. Choose a `ViewKind`.
4. Choose a `RendererKind`.
5. Select a data source.
6. Adjust a JSONata transform.
7. Preview the view live.
8. Save the ViewSpec.

Raw JSON editing is allowed as an advanced/debug path, but it is not the
primary authoring flow.

`MoldQL` is the query language for ViewSpec data sources. It selects objects,
graph relations, docs, evidence, and architecture artifacts. It does not
describe visual layout. Layout remains the responsibility of `RendererKind`,
renderer props, and the frontend `RendererRegistry`.

Examples:

```text
symbols where kind = "function" and fan_out > 5
calls from "UserService::create_user" depth 3
docs citing adr "ADR-008"
```

Entry points resolve into views through a common pipeline:

```text
User input
  ↓
EntryPointResolver
  ↓
ResolvedEntryPoint
  ↓
Default ViewKind selection
  ↓
ViewSpec or built-in view
  ↓
RendererRegistry
```

Each `ResolvedEntryPoint` kind has a default `ViewKind`, but the Explorer lets
the user switch to any applicable view after resolution:

| Entry point | Resolved kind | Default ViewKind |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| `POST /api/users` | `HttpRoute` | `vertical_slice` |
| `cognicode analyze` | `CliCommand` | `vertical_slice` |
| `UserCreated` | `Event` | `data_flow` |
| `CreateUser` | `UseCase` | `vertical_slice` |
| `UserRepository::save` | `Symbol` | `call_graph` |

Search/Spotter is a universal entry point. It searches symbols, files, modules,
entry points, ViewSpecs, ADRs, decisions, docs, issues, evidence, and saved
explorations. Results are represented as `semantic_search_results`, not as a
flat list, so the result set can be filtered, grouped, rendered differently,
saved as a ViewSpec, or opened as inspector panes.

## Rationale

- **Rust registry alone is not moldable enough.** It is safe and extensible for core developers, but it cannot provide instant user-defined views.
- **ViewSpec as data restores dynamism.** Users can create, edit, preview, and persist views from the Explorer without recompilation.
- **Semantic intent and rendering must not be conflated.** A vertical slice is not a renderer; it is a composite semantic view that may use graph, tree, code, and table renderers together.
- **Explorer-first authoring mirrors moldable development.** Users should turn an exploration path into a contextual view from the place where the discovery happens.
- **Entry point defaults reduce friction without removing choice.** CogniCode can open the most useful view automatically while keeping all applicable views available.
- **MoldQL should not become a second rendering language.** Keeping querying separate from rendering prevents a confused DSL that mixes data selection, transformation, and UI layout.
- **Frontend owns visual variety.** React already has the component ecosystem needed for graph, table, tree, code, and declarative chart renderers.
- **Backend owns semantic correctness.** Object resolution, entry point resolution, source data, graph data, and authorization remain server-side.
- **MCP can degrade.** MCP tools can list and inspect ViewSpecs, but they do not need to fully render browser-only visualizations.
- **JSONata is preferred for v1 transforms.** It is stronger than JSONLogic for reshaping, aggregation, grouping, and tabular projections.
- **Vega-Lite is preferred for declarative charts.** It provides a mature JSON grammar for interactive visualizations.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Pure trait-based ViewRegistry:** rejected as the only mechanism because every new custom view requires Rust code and recompilation.
- **Attribute macro only:** useful for built-in ergonomics, but still compile-time and not enough for runtime moldability.
- **YAML/TOML only:** weaker authoring and validation story than JSON ViewSpecs stored and validated by the backend.
- **Embedded JS runtime in backend:** postponed. QuickJS/Deno-style scripting adds security and operational complexity before there is proof that JSONata is insufficient.
- **WASM plugins for all custom views:** postponed. Powerful but too heavy for everyday view authoring; keep as future/pro extension tier.
- **Frontend-only custom views:** rejected because backend must remain the source of truth for object resolution, graph data, and source analysis.

## Consequences

- `ContextualView` and `ViewBlock` remain useful as stable transport types.
- `NamedView` should evolve from saved graph projection parameters into a more general persisted ViewSpec mechanism.
- The frontend `ViewBlock` switch should evolve toward a `RendererRegistry` map.
- Graph rendering should become embeddable inside the block/view pipeline, not isolated only in the right-side graph panel.
- Custom runtime views become Explorer-first; MCP support is best-effort.
- v1 scope stays intentionally bounded: no external plugin host, no remote React renderer loading, no WASM view plugins, and no embedded JS runtime.

## Validation

- [ ] Built-in views are discoverable without central hardcoded match arms.
- [ ] A user can create a ViewSpec in the Explorer and see it immediately without backend recompilation.
- [ ] The same object lists both built-in views and persisted runtime ViewSpecs.
- [ ] Unknown renderer ids degrade to raw JSON or a clear unsupported-renderer message.
- [ ] MCP can list/read ViewSpecs even when it cannot render them visually.
- [ ] JSONata transforms are sandboxed and bounded by execution limits.
