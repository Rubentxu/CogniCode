## Future

_(none — all roadmap items closed)_

The 3 previously-listed items (`cognicode-axiom`, `cognicode-quality`, `cognicode-rule-test-harness` re-activation) were **archived** on 2026-06-25 per ADR-001 trigger (b) — moved to `docs/parked-crates/` rather than revived. See ADR-001 §Archive Action. The C5 rename, multi-workspace `quality_gate`, and quality agent ingest items shipped in v0.24.0.

## Conventions

- Roadmap entries are **date-sorted descending** within each section.
- Each entry links to: branch (Active), tag + PR (Completed), or ADR/scenario (Future).
- The `quality-stack-pg-canonical` entry includes a follow-up commit (`ad35e06`) that landed AFTER the original PR merged; both are part of the same change for the purposes of this roadmap.
- When an item shifts from Future to Completed (or to Archived), the entry is moved and the source ADR/spec is cited.
